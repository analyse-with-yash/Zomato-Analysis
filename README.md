# Zomato-Analysis

Zomato Sales Dashboard
This project takes raw Zomato data and turns it into a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard that tells the story of restaurants, ratings, cuisines, and customer preferences across multiple countries and cities.

What’s in the Dashboard
Restaurant Distribution – See how 9.54K+ restaurants are spread across 140 cities in 15 countries.

Cuisine Popularity – Discover which cuisines rule the charts (North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food… and more).

Ratings & Reviews – Visual breakdown of “Excellent,” “Very Good,” “Good,” and more, with total votes hitting 3.74M+.

Cost Analysis – Compare the average cost for two across locations.

City Highlights – New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida take the top spots for restaurant count.

Why I Built This
Food data is messy, and without a good visual, you can miss key patterns. This dashboard makes it easy to answer questions like:

Which cities dominate Zomato’s listings?

What cuisines are most in demand?

How do ratings and votes reflect customer preferences?

Where is dining the most expensive?
